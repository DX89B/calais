== DESCRIPTION:
  
A Ruby interface to the Open Calais API (http://opencalais.com)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Basic access to the Open Calais API's Enlighten action.
* Accepts documents in text/plain, text/xml and text/html format.
* Output is RDF representation of input document.

== SYNOPSIS:

This is a very basic wrapper to the Open Calais API. It uses the POST endpoint and currently supports the Enlighten action. Here's a simple call:

  Calais.enlighten(:content => "The government of the United Kingdom has given corporations like fast food chain McDonald's the right to award high school qualifications to employees who complete a company training program.", :content_type => :text)

This is the easiest way to get the RDF-formated response from the OpenCalais service.

If you want to do something more fun like getting all the names from a body of text, try this:

  Calais.names(:content => "The government of the United Kingdom has given corporations like fast food chain McDonald's the right to award high school qualifications to employees who complete a company training program.", :content_type => :text)

This will return an hash of arrays that would look like this:

  {"Country"=>["United Kingdom"], "Company"=>["McDonald's"], "IndustryTerm"=>["food chain"]}

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 1.8.5 or better
  * Uses the following standard libraries: digest/sha1, net/http, rexml/document, yaml

== INSTALL:

TODO
